This was the continuation of the Genshin Impact Website but made with Vue.JS this time and an emphasis on usability on all screen sizes including mobile. Similarly, works as an informational website intended as a wiki only for the Fontaine region in Genshin impact so it is much smaller in scope. I took what i learned from the previous website and implemented it here.
